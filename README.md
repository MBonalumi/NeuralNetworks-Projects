# Neural Networks projects
This repository consist of the two parts that composed a project of Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

In particular:
- the first challenge consisted in writing and hypertuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting fruit trees from pictures of their leaves.
- the second challenge consisted in writing a Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs and GRUs) and a Transformer Neural Networks capable of predicting timeseries data.

Part of the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning @ Polimi.
